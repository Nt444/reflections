When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

While team working.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with remote repository?

To not have in shared remote repository unfinished changes.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branchas. When would you use one instead of another.

Forks are clones of repositories within GitHub. Clones are complete copies of repositories in all other cases.
Branchas are special labels for commits.
