    Quik error search and the ability to roll back will save a lot of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    pros: unnecessary information is not saved
	cons: something might be forgotten (to save)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

    Because of the particulars of coding oriented control systems

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
